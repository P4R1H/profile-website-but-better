📖 The Builder's Journey

The Origin: "I need to see how it works"

For a normal 8-year-old receiving a gift, the excitement is usually about playing with it. For me, the first thought was always: "I need to open this up and see how it works."

If asked for my defining trait, I’d say this: I have always been a builder.
Whether it was constructing forts from every pillow in the house, following YouTube origami tutorials, or forgetting hunger and thirst while spending hours on LEGO sets, I was obsessed with creation. I didn't just want toys; I wanted tools. While peers wanted PlayStations, I wanted 3D printers, drills, and CNC machines. I knew that with the right tools, the potential to build was limitless.

The Spark: Discovering the Ultimate Tool

My passion for programming began in 4th grade when school introduced me to Scratch. dragging those code blocks was a revelation. I realized that code was the most accessible, scalable, and powerful tool in existence. I had to have it in my arsenal.

By 10th grade, I wasn't just learning; I was deploying. I created bots for Reddit and Discord communities that moderated over 10 million members—tools that are still in use today. This confirmed a core belief: Having the knowledge to apply the perfect tool for the job is half the battle.

The Grind: Growth Over Comfort

That hunger for knowledge never faded; it got sharper. While others treated university holidays as downtime, I pushed myself through the uncomfortable daily metro trips from Ghaziabad to Saket or Gurgaon. I did this not for monetary gain, but because I knew the learning was worth it.

I built things that made a real difference—whether it was streamlining operations for teams at Persona Essential or bringing joy to 150,000+ users on StockPiece.

The Now: Chasing the Edge

Now at 20, I’m still chasing that same feeling: the thrill of being slightly unprepared, slightly on edge, but pushing for growth anyway. I am looking for a place where I can bring this passion, contribute to a team that is bigger than me, and create work that truly matters.
